# Shopping Cart API

We are developing a shopping cart API. But there are a lot of issues with this current approach. We would like your help in improving this code.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- VS code/ any IDE
- Postman to test the APIs

## Setup guide

docker-compose up -d

## Story: 
### As an admin user I want to update product information and quantity from the product API.

Please refer to the API routes at the bottom of this readme and implement an API to provide this functionality.

## Available mock APIs

GET http://localhost:9001/api/products/index

POST http://localhost:9001/api/product/create
